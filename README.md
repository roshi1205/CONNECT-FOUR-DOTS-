Welcome to my version of the Connect Four game. A blend of logic, design, and interactivity – all built from scratch using the holy trinity of the web: HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

🎮 Game Overview

Connect Four is a timeless two-player game where strategy meets speed. Drop your discs, block your opponent, and be the first to connect four in a row — vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
